	Abstract = { ▪ Abstract  We focus on the implications of movement, landscape variables, and spatial heterogeneity for food web dynamics. Movements of nutrients, detritus, prey, and consumers among habitats are ubiquitous in diverse biomes and can strongly influence population, consumer-resource, food web, and community dynamics. Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure. Landscape variables such as the perimeter/area ratio of the focal habitat, permeability of habitat boundaries, and relative productivity of trophically connected habitats affect the degree and importance of spatial subsidization. },

@article{Abrams1995,
	Abstract = {This article discusses how the presence of dynamic change in traits affecting inter-specific interactions changes the ways in which interactions between species are distinguished, classified, and measured. The prevalence of models lacking any trait dynamics has led to methods of identifying and measuring indirect effects that are not valid when phenotypically or evolutionarily plastic traits affect interspecific interactions. When traits are dynamic, the number of links in a dynamic model can no longer be used to distinguish direct and indirect effects, and classifying interactions by a single sign denoting effect on equilibrium density becomes problematic. The presence of trait dynamics also changes the interpretation of manipulative experiments that have been used to measure indirect effects. Because both traits and population densities can transmit indirect effects, a given ordered series of species will often transmit several indirect effects, which may have opposite signs. Because some traits can change very rapidly, dynamic equations describing population growth rates may often include the densities of species that interact indirectly with the given species. Some of the conceptual problems in comparing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are illustrated by simple models of a three-species food chain. Different methods of measuring effect magnitudes can give different conditions for when direct effects are larger than indirect effects. Other terminology related to indirect effects, including interaction modification and higher-order interaction, is critically discussed. Given the present paucity of information about trait dynamics, it may be premature to attempt to compare magnitudes of direct and indirect effects.},

@article{Allen-Wardell1998,
	Abstract = {Following reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource managers from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada come together to review the quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leaves us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollination may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans. (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on the wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plants; (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the "nectar corridors" of threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay, public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants.},

	Abstract = {The characteristics of flowers influence most aspects of angiosperm reproduction, including the agents of pollination and patterns of mating. Thus, a clear view of the forces that mediate floral phenotypic evolution is central to understanding angiosperm diversity. Here, we inform on the capacity for floral phenotype to respond to selection by reviewing published data on heritabilities and genetic correlations for several classes of floral traits (primary sexual, attraction, mating system) in hermaphroditic plants. We find significant heritability for all floral traits but also variation among them, as well as a tendency for heritability to vary with mating system, but not life history. We additionally test predictions stemming from life history theory (eg, negative covariation between male-female traits and flower size-flower number), and ideas concerning the extent and pattern of genetic integration between flowers and leaves, and between the sexes of dioecious and gynodioecious species. We find mixed evidence for life history tradeoffs. We find strong support for floral integration and its relation with floral morphology (actinomorphy vs zygomorphy) and for a decoupling of floral and vegetative traits, but no evidence that modular integration varies with floral morphology. Lastly, we find mixed evidence for a relationship between the level of sexual dimorphism in attraction traits and the between-sex correlation in gender dimorphic plants.},

	Abstract = {Despite widespread concern about declines in pollination services, little is known about the patterns of change in most pollinator assemblages. By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre-versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species.},

	Abstract = {Habitat loss poses a major threat to biodiversity, and species-specific extinction risks are inextricably linked to life-history characteristics. This relationship is still poorly documented for many functionally important taxa, and at larger continental scales. With data from five replicated field studies from three countries, we examined how species richness of wild bees varies with habitat patch size. We hypothesized that the form of this relationship is affected by body size, degree of host plant specialization and sociality. Across all species, we found a positive species-area slope (z = 0.19), and species traits modified this relationship. Large-bodied generalists had a lower z value than small generalists. Contrary to predictions, small specialists had similar or slightly lower z value compared with large specialists, and small generalists also tended to be more strongly affected by habitat loss as compared with small specialists. Social bees were negatively affected by habitat loss (z = 0.11) irrespective of body size. We conclude that habitat loss leads to clear shifts in the species composition of wild bee communities.},

@article{Callaway2005,
	Abstract = {Exotic plant invasions often cause high mortality in native populations and therefore have the potential to be a powerful selective force. We found that surviving individuals from North American communities that have experienced extensive invasion by Centaurea maculosa have higher tolerances to the Eurasian invader than individuals from communities that did not experience invasion. Some native species grown from the seed of individuals that survived Centaurea invasion were more resistant to the general competitive effects of Centaurea, the root exudates from Centaurea, and to a chemical specific to the root exudates of Centaurea ($\pm$)-catechin. Although these results may be confounded by maternal effects, they provide initial evidence that native plant species may evolve to tolerate the effects of an exotic invader, and in particular an invader's novel allelochemistry. Such effects may have long-term implications for plant invasions and the organization of plant communities. Evolved tolerance may ultimately contribute to coexistence among natives and invaders, with our results suggesting that natural plant communities may be more coevolved and less individualistic than currently thought.

@article{Campbell1996,
	Abstract = {Genetic variances, heritabilities, and genetic correlations of floral traits were measured in the monocarpic perennial Ipomopsts aggregata (Polemoniaceae). A paternal half-sib design was employed to generate seeds in each of four years, and seeds were planted back in the field near the parental site. The progeny were followed for up to eight years to estimate quantitative genetic parameters subject to natural levels of environmental variation over the entire life cycle. Narrow-sense heritabilities of 0.2-0.8 were detected for the morphometric traits of corolla length, corolla width, stigma position, and anther position. The proportion of time spent by the protandrous flowers in the pistillate phase ("proportion pistillate") also exhibited detectable heritability of near 0.3. In contrast, heritability estimates for nectar reward traits were low and not significantly different from zero, due to high environmental variance between and within flowering years. The estimates of genetic parameters were combined with phenotypic selection gradients to predict evolutionary responses to selection mediated by the hummingbird pollinators. One trait, corolla width, showed the potential for a rapid response to ongoing selection through male function, as it experienced both direct selection, by influencing pollen export, and relatively high heritability. Predicted responses were lower for proportion pistillate and corolla length, even though these traits also experienced direct selection. Stigma position was expected to respond positively to indirect selection of proportion pistillate but negatively to selection of corolla length, with the net effect sensitive to variation in the selection estimates. Anther position also was not directly selected but could respond to indirect selection of genetically correlated traits.},

	Abstract = {The strength and direction of natural selection on floral traits can vary spatially and temporally because of variation in the biotic and abiotic environment. High spatial variation in selection should lead to differentiation of floral traits among populations. In contrast, high temporal variation in selection should retard the evolution of population-specific floral phenotypes. To determine the relative importance of spatial vs. temporal variation in natural selection, we measured phenotypic selection on seven floral traits of the wildflowers Lobelia cardinalis and L. siphilitica in 1999 and 2000. Lobelia cardinalis experienced significant temporal variation in selection. whereas L. siphilitica experienced spatial variation in selection on the same traits. This variation in selection on floral traits was associated with spatial and temporal differences in the soil microenvironment. Although few studies of natural selection include spatial or temporal replicates, our results suggest that such replication is critical for understanding the distribution of phenotypes in nature.},

Nevertheless, tension among these goals engenders potential ethical conflicts., conservationists' true motivations may differ from the justifications they offer for their activities, and conservation projects have the potential to disempower and oppress people. We reviewed the promise and deficiencies of integrating social, economic, and biological concerns into conservation, focusing on research in ecosystem services and efforts in community-based conservation. Despite much progress, neither paradigm provides a silver bullet for conservation's most pressing problems, and both require additional thought and modification to become maximally effective. We conclude that the following strategies are needed to make conservation more effective in our human-dominated world. (1) Conservation research needs to integrate with social scholarship in a more sophisticated manner (2) Conservation must be informed by a detailed understanding of the spatial, temporal, and social distributions of costs and benefits of conservation efforts. Strategies should reflect this understanding, particularly by equitably distributing conservation's costs, (3) We must better acknowledge the social concerns that accompany biodiversity conservation; accordingly, sometimes we must argue for conservation for biodiversity's sake, not for its direct human benefits.},

	Abstract = {The rise of extinction rates associated with human activities has led to a growing interest in identifying extinction-prone taxa and extinction-promoting drivers. Previous work has identified habitat alterations and invasive species as the major drivers of recent bird extinctions. Here, we extend this work to ask how these human-driven impacts differentially affect extinction-prone taxa, and if any specific driver promotes taxonomic homogenization of avifauna. Like most previous studies, our analysis is based on global information of extinction drivers affecting threatened and extinct bird species from the IUCN Red List. Unlike previous studies, we employ a multivariate statistical framework that allows us to identify the main gradients of variation in extinction drivers. By using these gradients, we show that bird families with the highest extinction risk are primarily associated with threats posed by invasive species, once species richness and phylogeny are taken into account. As expected, the negative impact of invasive species was higher on island species, but our results also showed that it was particularly high in those species with small distribution ranges. On the other hand, mainland species and island species with large ranges tended to be affected by habitat destruction. Thus the impacts of invasive species promote the process of taxonomic homogenization among islands and between islands and continents. Consequently, introduced species may increase biotic homogenization not only directly, as generally believed, but also indirectly through their disproportional impact on endemic species imperilment.},

	Abstract = {Both the magnitude and the urgency of the task of assessing global biodiversity require that we make the most of what we know through the use of estimation and extrapolation. Likewise, future biodiversity inventories need to be designed around the use of effective sampling and estimation procedures, especially for 'hyperdiverse' groups of terrestrial organisms, such as arthropods, nematodes, fungi, and microorganisms. The challenge of estimating patterns of species richness from samples can be separated into (i) the problem of estimating local species richness, and (ii) the problem of estimating the distinctness, or complementarity, of species assemblages. These concepts apply on a wide range of spatial, temporal, and functional scales. Local richness can be estimated by extrapolating species accumulation curves, fitting parametric distributions of relative abundance, or using non-parametric techniques based on the distribution of individuals among species or of species among samples. We present several of these methods and examine their effectiveness for an example data set. We present a simple measure of complementarity, with some biogeographic examples, and outline the difficult problem of estimating complementarity from samples. Finally, we discuss the importance of using 'reference' sites (or sub-sites) to assess the true richness and composition of species assemblages, to measure ecologically significant ratios between unrelated taxa, to measure taxon/sub-taxon (hierarchical) ratios, and to 'calibrate' standardized sampling methods. This information can then be applied to the rapid, approximate assessment of species richness and faunal or floral composition at 'comparative' sites.},

We discuss the evolutionary consequences of disturbance on plant mating systems, and in particular whether reproductive assurance through selfing effectively compensates for reduced outcrossing. The extent to which disturbance reduces pollinator versus mate availability could generate diverse selective forces on reproductive traits. Investigating how anthropogenic change influences plant mating will lead to new opportunities for better understanding of how mating systems evolve, as well as of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of human activities and how to mitigate them.},

	Abstract = {The anther-smut Microbotryum violaceum, causes a systemic perennial infection of its host Silene dioica. Infection results in sterility and the production of teliospores in flowers. These spores are transmitted to healthy plants by flower visiting insects. The behavioural responses of flower visiting insects to a variation in floral characters are therefore likely to affect rates of pollen export/import, the rate of spore deposition and probability of disease. Since infected plants are sterilised, they are effectively removed from the gene pool. It is therefore often assumed that in this host-pathogen system there is a considerable potential for a pathogen-pollinator mediated selection on floral characters. In a transplantation experiment, which included plants from four different populations, we tested for correlations between variation in female floral morphology and patterns of spore and pollen deposition, and a resulting risk of disease. The source populations in this experiment were located on four islands in Skeppsvik archipelago in northern Sweden, and represented a gradient of disease incidence from completely healthy (Island 1), low incidence (Island 2) to high incidences (Islands 3 and 4) of disease. Fifty plants from each population were transplanted to the centre of the population on Island 4. Plants from the non-diseased population had larger flowers and longer styles than plants from the highly diseased populations. Numbers of pollen grains and spores deposited on flowers were strongly and positively correlated. We found that plants originating from the healthy population received approximately four times more pollen and nine times more spores per flower than the individuals from the resident diseased population. The resulting incidences of disease among plants from the four populations differed significantly, and was 20\% among plants originating from the healthy population and 0\% among plants from the resident highly diseased population. Plants from the other two diseased populations showed intermediate values (13\% and 11\% respectively). In a survey of ten populations we found among healthy plants a significant negative correlation between mean style length (positively correlated with corolla size and ovule number) and incidence of disease. The potential for pathogen-pollinator mediated selection on floral characters in this host-pathogen system is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The majority of flowering plants require animals for pollination, a critical ecosystem service in natural and agricultural systems. However, quantifying useful estimates of pollinator visitation rates can be nearly impossible when pollinator visitation is infrequent. We examined the utility of an indirect measure of pollinator visitation, namely pollen receipt by flowers, using the hummingbird-pollinated plant, Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae). Our a priori hypothesis was that increased pollinator visitation should result in increased pollen receipt by stigmas. However, the relationship between pollinator visitation rate and pollen receipt may be misleading if pollen receipt is a function of both the number of pollinator visits and variation in pollinator efficiency at depositing pollen, especially in the context of variable floral morphology. Therefore, we measured floral and plant characters known to be important to pollinator visitation and/or pollen receipt in I. aggregata (corolla length and width and plant height) and used path analysis to dissect and compare the effect of pollinator visitation rate vs. pollinator efficiency on pollen receipt. Of the characters we measured, pollinator visitation rate (number of times plants were visited multiplied by the mean percentage of flowers probed per visit) had the strongest direct positive effect on pollen receipt, explaining 36\% of the variation in pollen receipt. Plant height had a direct positive effect on pollinator visitation rate and an indirect positive effect on pollen receipt. Despite the supposition that floral characters would directly affect pollen receipt as a result of changes in pollinator efficiency, corolla length and width only weakly affected pollen receipt. These results suggest a direct positive link between pollinator visitation rate and pollen receipt across naturally varying floral morphology in I. aggregata. Understanding the relationship between pollinator visitation rate and pollen receipt may be of critical importance in systems where pollinator visitation is difficult to quantify.},

We explore how the size of the patch in which central\^{a}€ place foraging occurs and the spatial distribution of foragers within that patch feed back to influence the population dynamics of the central\^{a}€ place forager and the species richness of the associated recipient community. We demonstrate that the particular way in which a population of central\^{a}€ place foragers uses space has two important effects. First, space use determines the stability of the forager population and establishes patch size thresholds for persistence, stable equilibria, and limit cycles. Second, alternative foraging kernels lead to qualitatively different scaling relationships between the size of the foraging patch and species richness back at the central place. These analyses provide a new link among elements of ecology related to animal behavior, population dynamics, and species diversity while also providing a novel perspective on the utility of integrodifference equations for problems in spatial ecology.},

	Abstract = {abstract: Traditionally, ecologists interested in habitat edges have focused on edge\^{a}€ related gradients in patterns of species richness or abiotic variables. Here, however, we take a different perspective, attempting to synthesize recent empirical results concerning the effects of habitat edges on population dynamics with contemporary theoretical developments to outline the ways in which species interactions, and the dynamics of the communities in which they are embedded, can be changed by habitat edges. We find a striking convergence between empirical notions of a patch's core area and analytical results from partial differential equation models. A review of both empirical and theoretical studies suggests four general classes of mechanisms through which habitat edges can have similar impacts on dissimilar types of species interactions. Specifically, we focus on edges' roles as dispersal barriers or filters, edges' influences on mortality, edges' involvement in spatial subsidies (in which dispersers' intrapatch impacts are maintained by their activities in other habitats), and edges' roles as generators of novel interactions. For each class of edge\^{a}€ mediated effects, we provide examples of how one can use spatial modeling to address the relevant questions on these topics, which together form a key link between community dynamics and landscape structure.},

	Abstract = {In flowering plants, pollen limitation has been proposed to intensify selection on floral characters important in pollinator attraction, but may also select for traits that increase seed set through autonomous selfing. Here, a factorial design (+/- pollen addition, +/- pollinator removal) was used to investigate how the pollination environment affects selection on floral morphology via female fitness in a mixed-mating population of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus (Phrymaceae). Female fitness was strongly pollen-limited, with supplementally pollinated plants setting 37\% more seeds than open-pollinated individuals. Strong positive selection was found on flower length, weak positive selection on flower width : length ratio and no selection on stigma-anther distance in both open-pollinated and supplementally pollinated treatments. By contrast, flowers with relatively narrow corollas and low stigma-anther distances were favored in the pollinator exclusion treatment. These results provide mixed support for the idea that pollen limitation intensifies selection on floral characters. Despite strong phenotypic selection, natural pollen limitation did not mediate selection on characters associated with either pollinator attraction or self-fertilization. However, the novel pattern of selection on severely pollen-limited plants suggests that reproductive assurance against pollinator loss may have been directly involved in the floral evolution of closely related selfing taxa.},

Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

	Abstract = {1. Aspects of the flowering biology of wild cashew Anacardium occidentale, an andromonoecious, self-fertile tree, were studied in the north-east of Brazil, where this species is endemic. Comparison was made among two bee species, Apis mellifera and Centris tarsata, in their pollination of cashew flowers using a number of measures including single bee visits to marked flowers. 2. Cashew flowering is protandrous within a day. Male flowers greatly outnumber hermaphrodite flowers. Stigmas lose receptivity rapidly and pollen is quickly removed from anthers yet flowers remain intact for several days. 3. Only females of C. tarsata collected pollen from cashew flowers, and then only from male flowers. The similar foraging behaviour of the nectar collectors of the two bet species under investigation when visiting hermaphrodite cashew flowers suggests that they may both act as good pollinators. 4. We develop an index of efficiency of pollen removal from anthers (PREi) whereby the relative benefits of flower visitors to a component of a plant's male reproductive success can be quantified. 5. Comparisons of single bee visits to flowers with unvisited flowers and others receiving unlimited visits were used to show that: C. tarsata pollen collectors were more efficient than nectar collectors of either bee species at removing pollen from anthers: nectar collectors of both bee species had similar pollen removal efficiencies; C. tarsata was more efficient at depositing pollen on stigmas than A. mellifera; both bee species had statistically similar efficiencies at setting seed. 6. The indices of efficiency for some of the stages in the pollination of cashew suggest that C. tarsata flower visits may enhance plant reproductive success over flower visits by A. mellifera but that both bee species may be suitable for the pollination of commercially grown cashew. 7. Despite cashew's single ovule per flower, high nut set demands a high rate of pollinator visitation during the peak time of stigma receptivity. Provision of additional bee pollination in commercial orchards is recommended to obtain good nut yields.},

	Abstract = {Pollinators are required for producing 15-30\% of the human food supply, and farmers rely on managed honey bees throughout the world to provide these services. Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.},

This review considers the legacy of Darwin's ideas from three perspectives. First, we examine the process of floral and inflorescence adaptation by surveying studies of phenotypic selection, heritability and selection responses. Despite widespread phenotypic and genetic capacity for natural selection, only one-third of estimates indicate phenotypic selection. Second, we evaluate experimental studies of floral and inflorescence function and find that they usually demonstrate that reproductive traits represent adaptations. Finally, we consider the role of adaptation in floral diversification. Despite different diversification modes (coevolution, divergent use of the same pollen vector, pollinator shifts), evidence of pollination ecotypes and phylogenetic patterns suggests that adaptation commonly contributes to floral diversity. Thus, this review reveals a contrast between the inconsistent occurrence of phenotypic selection and convincing experimental and comparative evidence that floral traits are adaptations. Rather than rejecting Darwin's hypotheses about floral evolution, this contrast suggests that the tempo of creative selection varies, with strong, consistent selection during episodes of diversification, but relatively weak and inconsistent selection during longer, 'normal' periods of relative phenotypic stasis.

	Abstract = {In coastal California, the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) displaces nearly all above ground foraging native ant species. The loss of native ants following invasion by Argentine ants homogenizes these faunas; natural habitats invaded by L. humile have lower beta diversity compared to comparable uninvaded areas. Argentine ant abundance in the seasonally dry mediterranean environments of this region correlates strongly and positively with soil moisture. For this reason, the displacement of native ants across natural and artificial moisture gradients often resembles an edge effect, the magnitude of which is inversely proportional to the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile. The direct effects of Argentine ant invasions in natural environments are therefore amplified by inputs of urban and agricultural run off. Indirect ecological effects of these invasions arise from the loss of large-bodied ants, arid adapted ants, and behavioral repertoires unique to particular native ant species. Further research is needed to quantify how these aspects of functional homogenization affect invaded communities. The close association between L. humile and moist soils suggests that, at least in arid regions, control strategies might be aimed at reducing urban run off in order to maintain functionally diverse communities of native ants.},

	Abstract = {Two alternative paradigms exist for coevolutionary processes in plant-herbivore systems: "pairwise" and "diffuse." There is little empirical evidence indicating which mode is more common, in part, we believe, because of an absence of explicit criteria by which the two modes can be distinguished. We present such a criterion, which states that, for selection imposed by different herbivores to be independent (pairwise coevolution), not only must there be no genetic correlation among plant resistances to the different species of herbivores, but also there must be no ecological interactions whereby one herbivore affects the evolution of resistance to other species, We present a model that demonstrates the validity of this criterion. We tested whether this criterion is satisfied by the annual morning glory Ipomoea purpurea and two of its insect herbivores, Deloyala guttata and Bedellia somnulentella, by conducting both greenhouse and field experiments. We placed various densities of the two insect species on plants in a factorial design and tested for a statistical interaction between densities of the two species on plant fitness. We did not detect an interaction in either experiment. Our results suggest, therefore, that selection exerted by insect herbivores on resistance in I. purpurea is pairwise rather than diffuse.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

	Abstract = {Populations of the tristylous, annual Eichhornia paniculata are markedly differentiated with respect to frequency of mating types. This variation is associated with evolutionary changes in mating system, from predominant outcrossing to high self-fertilization. To assess the potential influence of genetic drift acting on this variation, we estimated effective population size in 10 populations from northeastern Brazil using genetic and demographic methods. Effective size (Ne) was inferred from temporal changes in allele frequency at two to eight isozyme loci and also calculated using five demographic variables: 1) the number of flowering individuals (N); 2) temporal fluctuations in N; 3) variance in flower number; 4) frequency of mating types; and 5) selfing rate. Average Ne based on isozyme data was 15.8, range 3.4-70.6, and represented a fraction (mean Ne/N = 0.106) of the census number of individuals (mean N = 762.8; range: 30.5-5,040). Temporal variation in N and variance in flower number each reduced Ne to about a half of N, whereas mating type frequencies and selfing rate caused only small reductions in Ne relative to N. All estimates of Ne based on demographic variables were considerably larger than those obtained from genetic data. The two kinds of estimates were in general agreement, however, when all demographic variables were combined into a single measure. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that effective size must be fewer than about 40 for drift to overcome the frequency-dependent selection that maintains the polymorphism for mating type. Applying the average Ne/N value to 167 populations censused in northeastern Brazil indicated that 72\% had effective sizes below this number. This suggests that genetic drift is likely to play a dominant role in natural populations of E. paniculata.},

@article{Inouye2001,
	Abstract = {A major empirical approach in community ecology is to describe the dynamics of a community by examining small subsets of species. Unfortunately, interaction modifications, which cause pair-wise interaction coefficients to depend on the presence or absence of additional species, can make it difficult to predict the overall dynamics of species within a community from experiments with pairs of species. In a similar fashion, one of the major approaches in evolutionary ecology has been to describe the likely evolutionary dynamics of a single species by focusing on the selection imposed by a limited number of other species within the community. However, recent work on diffuse coevolution indicates that selection pressures due to one species can change in the presence of other species. The magnitude of the difficulty that interaction modifications and diffuse coevolution present for predicting ecological and evolutionary dynamics is an unresolved question. Here we outline the similarities and differences between the two topics, discuss experimental and statistical approaches to studying them, and make predictions about when ecological interaction modifications are likely to cause diffuse coevolution. Since the currencies for interaction modifications are usually fitness components such as growth, fecundity, or survival, is it likely that these will translate into corresponding differences in the relative fitness of individuals or genotypes, and thus in general these two phenomena will occur together. We argue that community ecologists and evolutionary ecologists will both benefit from experiments that test for the effects of interaction modifications, and that studies of the mechanisms driving interaction modifications and diffuse coevolution (e.g., changes in behavior, nonlinear effects on shared resources, genetic covariances) will aid our progress in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities.},

	Abstract = {Organisms experience a complex suite of species interactions. Although the ecological consequences of direct versus indirect species interactions have received attention, their evolutionary implications are not well understood. I examined selection on floral traits through direct versus indirect pathways of species interactions using the plant Ipomopsis aggregata and its pollinators and nectar robber. Using path analysis and structural equation modeling, I tested competing hypotheses comparing the relative importance of direct ( pollinator- mediated) versus indirect ( robber- mediated) interactions to trait selection through female plant function in 2 years. The hypothesis that provided the best fit to the observed data included robbing and pollination, suggesting that both interactors are important in driving selection on some traits; however, the direction and intensity of selection through robbing versus pollination varied between years. I then increased my scope of inference by assessing traits and species interactions across more years. I found that the potential for temporal variation in the direction and intensity of selection was pronounced. Taken together, results suggest that assessing the broader context in which organisms evolve, including both direct and indirect interactions and across multiple years, can provide increased mechanistic understanding of the diversity of ways that animals shape floral and plant evolution.},

	Abstract = {Studies of coevolution in plant-herbivore systems have typically focused on tight, pairwise interactions between one herbivore and one host plant species. Diffuse coevolution, by contrast, has received much less empirical attention, presumably because imprecise definitions of diffuse coevolution have hindered the development of experimental approaches for distinguishing between pairwise and diffuse coevolution. Here we provide a definition of diffuse coevolution that leads to three criteria for the operation of pairwise coevolution: susceptibilities (resistances) to different herbivores are genetically uncorrelated, the presence/absence of one herbivore does not affect the amount of damage caused by other herbivores, and the impact of one herbivore on plant fitness does not depend on the presence/absence of other herbivores. All three criteria must be satisfied for coevolution to be pairwise; if any of them fail, coevolution is diffuse. We then describe an experimental design and statistical analysis that permit the partitioning of the total selection imposed on a plant by a set of herbivores into components representing pairwise and diffuse selection, thus allowing determination of whether coevolution is pairwise or diffuse.},

	Abstract = {We studied the patterns of adaptive radiation in Disa, a large orchid genus in southern Africa. A cladogram for 27 species was constructed using 44 morphological characters. Pollination systems were then mapped onto the phylogeny in order to analyze pathways of floral evolution. Shifts from one pollination system to another have been a major feature of the evolutionary diversification of Disa. Unlike many plant genera that are pollinated mainly by a single group of insects, radiation in Disa has encompassed nearly all major groups of pollinating insects; in all, 19 different specialized pollination systems have been found in the 27 species included in this analysis. Another striking pattern is the repeated evolution of broadly similar pollination systems in unrelated clades. For example, butterfly-pollinated flowers have evolved twice; showy deceptive flowers pollinated by carpenter bees, twice; long-spurred flowers pollinated by long-tongued flies, four times; night-scented flowers pollinated by moths, three times; and self-pollination, three times. This suggests that a few dominant pollinator species in a region may be sufficient to generate diversification in plants through repeated floral shifts that never retrace the same pathways.},

	Abstract = {The pollination of flowering plants by animals represents a critical ecosystem service of great value to humanity, both monetary and otherwise. However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The "pollination crisis" that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural acid agricultural ecosystems.},

We suggest a novel mechanism--in systems in which mutualists of plants are present and important, predators can have indirect negative effects on producers through their consumption of mutualists. The strength of predator effects on producers will depend on their relative consumption of mutualists and antagonists, and on the relative importance of each to producer population dynamics. In a meta-analysis of experiments that examine the effects of predator reduction on the pollination and reproductive success of plants, we found that the indirect negative effects of predators on plants are quite strong. Most predator removal experiments measure the strength of predator effects on producers through the antagonist pathway; we suggest that a more complete understanding of the role of predators will be achieved by simultaneously considering the effects of predators on plant mutualists.},

	Abstract = {A basic principle of natural selection on correlated characters is expressed as an adaptive topography for the vector of mean phenotypes in a population. Under some simple conditions on the pattern of phenotypic and genetic covariation within populations, selection only on body size, certain types of multivariate selection, and random genetic drift in a stochastic phylogeny are each expected to produce allometric evolution, i.e., straight lines or linear regressions on logarithmic coordinates. The orientation of these lines is determined by genetic parameters of the populations. Using this theory, phylogenetic or comparative information can be combined with experimental data on population genetic parameters to test hypotheses about past selective forces. Data from selection experiments on brain and body weights in mice support the conclusions that [1] the short-term differentiation of brain and body sizes in very closely related mammalian forms resulted either from directional selection mostly on body size with changes in brain sizes largely a genetically correlated response, or from random genetic drift; [2] during the long-term allometric diversification within most mammalian orders there has been more net directional selection on brain sizes than on body sizes. It is suggested that encephalization in primates decreased the genetic correlation between brain size and body size within populations, which facilitated further encephalization in the human lineage by avoiding antagonistic selection on brain and body sizes. The evolution of brain:body ontogeny is briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {The impacts of agricultural practices and landscape composition on bee communities were investigated in 14 sites located in four Western European countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland). Standardized interviews with farmers assessed agricultural practices in terms of agricultural inputs (nitrogen fertilization and pesticides), livestock density and crop types. The proportion of semi-natural habitats was calculated for each site. We showed negative effects of agricultural intensification on species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees. By contrast, bee species richness increased with the amount of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Using a co-inertia analysis, we found an opposition between two types of agricultural specialization: towards crop production or towards animal husbandry. Species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees were greater in sites turned towards crop production. In these sites, flowering crops provided abundant food resources for bees whereas, in the other group of sites, intensive animal husbandry led to landscapes dominated by forage crops rather than flower-rich permanent grasslands. We also showed that bumblebees seemed to be less sensitive to agricultural intensification than solitary bees.},

A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007\^{a}€``08 growing seasons.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title> <p>We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60\% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47\% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98\%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm).</p> </sec><sec> <title>Conclusions/Significance</title> <p>The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.</p> </sec>},

	Abstract = {Nature provides a wide range of benefits to people. There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these "ecosystem services" into resource management decisions, but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder-defined scenarios of land-use/land-cover change in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity, suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values, but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff. Quantifying ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner, and analyzing tradeoffs between them, can help to make natural resource decisions more effective, efficient, and defensible.},

	Abstract = {New Phytologist (2009) 184: 7832013793 Agricultural weeds evolve in response to crop cultivation. Nevertheless, the central importance of evolutionary ecology for understanding weed invasion, persistence and management in agroecosystems is not widely acknowledged. This paper calls for more evolutionarily-enlightened weed management, in which management principles are informed by evolutionary biology to prevent or minimize weed adaptation and spread. As a first step, a greater knowledge of the extent, structure and significance of genetic variation within and between weed populations is required to fully assess the potential for weed adaptation. The evolution of resistance to herbicides is a classic example of weed adaptation. Even here, most research focuses on describing the physiological and molecular basis of resistance, rather than conducting studies to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of selection for resistance. We suggest approaches to increase the application of evolutionary-thinking to herbicide resistance research. Weed population dynamics models are increasingly important tools in weed management, yet these models often ignore intrapopulation and interpopulation variability, neglecting the potential for weed adaptation in response to management. Future agricultural weed management can benefit from greater integration of ecological and evolutionary principles to predict the long-term responses of weed populations to changing weed management, agricultural environments and global climate.},

	Abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity is often suggested as being important for the stability of populations, and promoted as a means to aid the conservation of species, but the evidence for such an assumption is poor. Here we show that heterogeneous landscapes that contain a variety of suitable habitat types are associated with more stable population dynamics for 35 British butterfly species from 166 sites. In addition, topographic heterogeneity may also promote stability. Our results were robust to different measures of population variability, differences in mean abundance among sites, and to the spatial scale (radius 120135 km around the centres of sites) at which landscapes were analysed. Responses to landscape heterogeneity differed among species; for more mobile 'wider-countryside' species, habitat heterogeneity at larger landscape scales had the strongest effect on population dynamics. We suggest that heterogeneous landscapes offer a greater range of resources and microclimates, which can buffer populations against climatic variation and generate more stable population dynamics.},

This provides a mechanism by which seed herbivores and pollinators could impose conflicting selection on. oral traits. We measured phenotypic selection on. oral traits of Lobelia siphilitica (Lobeliaceae) via female fitness to determine the relative strength of selection by pollinators and a specialist predispersal seed herbivore. We were able to attribute selection on flowering phenology to the herbivores. However, no selection could be attributed to pollinators, resulting in no conflicting selection on. oral traits. Unlike pollinators, whose preference for certain. oral traits does not always translate into higher fitness, any discrimination by seed herbivores is likely to decrease fitness of the preferred. oral phenotype. Thus predispersal seed herbivores may be a significant agent of selection on. oral traits.},

Nontarget effects can be of two sorts: (a) unintended negative effects on species that do not reduce yield and (b) greater persistence of the crop in feral populations. Conventional agricultural methods, such as herbicide and pesticide application, have large and well-documented nontarget effects. To the extent that transgenes have more specific target effects, transgenic crops may have fewer nontarget effects. The escape of transgenes into wild populations, via hybridization and introgression, could lead to increased weediness or to the invasion of new habitats by the wild population. In addition, native species with which the wild plant interacts (including herbivores, pathogens, and other plant species in the community) could be negatively affected by "transgenic-wild" plants. Conventional crop alleles have facilitated the evolution of increased weediness in several wild populations. Thus, some transgenes that allow plants to tolerate biotic and abiotic stress (e.g., insect resistance, drought tolerance) could have similar effects.},

	Abstract = {Artificial crosses between Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris using 1:9, 1:1, and 9:1 mixtures of intraspecific : interspecific pollen were conducted to determine the role of interspecific pollen competition as a reproductive barrier in Helianthus. Of 1,245 achenes analyzed from the pollen competition experiments, only 49 were hybrids. The number of hybrids observed was significantly less than expectations for all three pollen mixtures, regardless of the identity of maternal parent (P < 0.01). Stigma age and pollen ratio had no significant impact on hybrid frequency. However, hybrids were significantly more frequent with H. annuus than with H. petiolaris as the maternal parent (P < 0.01). Analysis of pollen tube growth rates revealed no differences in the rate of growth of intraspecific vs. interspecific pollen. Likewise, pollinations with either intraspecific or interspecific pollen or with different pollen ratios did not affect the percentage of filled achenes. Thus, the mechanism responsible for selective fertilization by intraspecific pollen in mixed pollen loads remains unclear. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that interspecific pollen competition plays an important role in controlling the formation of hybrids between H. annuus and H. petiolaris and may partially account for patterns or differential cytoplasmic vs. nuclear introgression in Helianthus.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of floral display and flowering time in animal-pollinated plants is commonly attributed to pollinator-mediated selection. Yet, the causes of selection on flowering phenology and traits contributing to floral display have rarely been tested experimentally in natural populations. We quantified phenotypic selection on morphological and phenological characters in the perennial, outcrossing herb Arabidopsis lyrata in two years using female reproductive success as a proxy of fitness. To determine whether selection on floral display and flowering phenology can be attributed to interactions with pollinators, selection was quantified both for open-pollinated controls and for plants receiving supplemental hand-pollination. We documented directional selection for many flowers, large petals, late start of flowering, and early end of flowering. Seed output was pollen-limited in both years and supplemental hand-pollination reduced the magnitude of selection on number of flowers, and reversed the direction of selection on end of flowering. The results demonstrate that interactions with pollinators may affect the strength of selection on floral display and the direction of selection on phenology of flowering in natural plant populations. They thus support the contention that pollinators can drive the evolution of both floral display and flowering time.},

	Abstract = {Trophic cascades are textbook examples of predator indirect effects on ecological systems. Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging-predation risk trade-offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade-off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators' presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade-off between intervening species.

	Abstract = {The strength and outcome of interspecific interactions often vary across the landscape because of differences in community context. We investigated how the presence or absence of pine squirrels (Tamiasciurits spp.) influences the ecology and (co)evolution of seed-dispersal mutualisms between Clark's Nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) and limber (Pinus flexilis) and whitebark (P. albicaulis) pines. Nutcrackers are the primary seed dispersers of these pines. Therefore both nutcrackers and pines potentially benefit from the evolution of a cone structure that enhances seed harvest by nutcrackers. Pine squirrels are the dominant predispersal seed predator of these pines throughout the Sierra Nevada-Cascades and Rocky Mountains and do not disperse seeds, so that pines benefit from deterring seed harvest by pine squirrels. To determine whether pines have evolved in response to selection by nutcrackers and pine squirrels, we conducted studies in ranges with pine squirrels and in ranges in the Great Basin and northern Montana where populations of the pines have apparently evolved without pine squirrels for 10000 years or more. Cone evolution was convergent between both pines and among phylogeographically independent populations with and without pine squirrels, consistent with variation in selection by nutcrackers and pine squirrels. Where pine squirrels were present, they out-competed nutcrackers for seeds, nutcrackers were less abundant, and selection by pine squirrels constrained the evolution of cone and seed traits that facilitate seed dispersal by nutcrackcrs. In the absence of pine squirrels, nutcrackers were more than twice as abundant, selection by pine squirrels on cone structure was relaxed, and selection on cone structure by nutcrackers resulted in cones that increased the foraging efficiency of nutcrackers and improved their potential for seed dispersal.},

	Abstract = {Changing land use and the spread of \^{a}€˜winning\^{a}€{\texttrademark} native or exotic plants are expected to lead to biotic homogenization (BH), in which previously distinct plant communities become progressively more similar. In parallel, many ecosystems have recently seen increases in local species (\^{I}$\pm$-) diversity, yet \^{I}³-diversity has continued to decline at larger scales. Using national ecological surveillance data for Great Britain, we quantify relationships between change in \^{I}$\pm$-diversity and between-habitat homogenizations at two levels of organization: species composition and plant functional traits. Across Britain both increases and decreases in \^{I}$\pm$-diversity were observed in small random sampling plots (10\^{a}€``200\^{a}€\v{S}m) located within a national random sample of 1\^{a}€\v{S}km square regions. As \^{I}$\pm$-diversity declined (spatially in 1978 or temporally between 1978 and 1998), plant communities became functionally more similar, but species-compositional similarity declined. Thus, different communities converged on a narrower range of winning trait syndromes, but species identities remained historically contingent, differentiating a mosaic of residual species-poor habitat patches within each 1\^{a}€\v{S}km square. The reverse trends in \^{I}²-diversity occurred where \^{I}$\pm$-diversity increased. When impacted by the same type and intensity of environmental change, directions of change in \^{I}$\pm$-diversity are likely to depend upon differences in starting productivity and disturbance. This is one reason why local diversity change and BH across habitats are not likely to be consistently coupled.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that interactions between species such as resource competition or reproductive interference will generate selection for character displacement where similar species co-occur. However, the rate and direction of character displacement will depend not only on the strength of selection for trait divergence, but also on the amount of genetic variation for selected traits and the nature of genetic correlations between them. To assess the importance of genetic constraints for the evolution of character displacement, we examined the genetic architecture of a suite of floral traits previously shown to be under selection in the annual plant Ipomoea hederacea when this species co-occurs with Ipomoea purpurea. We found that the six floral traits we measured are all positively genetically correlated. We also demonstrate, using new statistical approaches, that the predicted response to selection for four of these six traits is substantially constrained by their genetic correlation structure. Most notably, the response to selection for reduced separation of the tallest and shortest anthers, which reduces the degree of detrimental heterospecific pollen flow, is substantially constrained. Our results suggest that the rate of evolution of reproductive character displacement in I. hederacea is limited by the genetic architecture of floral traits.},

@article{Stanton2003,
	Abstract = {Most textbook treatments imply, and almost all theoretical analyses assume, that mutualistic interactions take place between a single pair of interacting partner species. A major goal of this symposium is to broaden and shift this pairwise perspective and make it concordant with the emerging view that locally exclusive mutualisms between just two species are the exception and that many communities include guilds of mutualistic species on one or both sides of the interaction. Many pollination and seed-dispersal mutualisms have long been recognized as diffuse, but recent molecular analyses are revealing unrecognized partner diversity in mutualistic interactions previously thought to be locally species specific. Co-occurring species within a mutualist guild are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent in the way they locate, compete for, and/or reward partners, and so intraguild interactions have the potential to influence population dynamics and patterns of selection in species on both sides of the mutualistic interaction. To illustrate some of these potential complexities for population dynamics, I use simple path analytic models to show that positive pairwise interactions between mutualists do not necessarily translate into positive net interactions within a mutualism involving more than two species. For example, when there is intraguild competition for partners, or even for resources external to the mutualism, the presence of a lower-quality mutualist can negatively affect the partner population by reducing associations it can form with better mutualists. Variation in quality among potential partners is likely to place a premium on traits or behaviors that enhance association with better mutualists. More investigations are needed to determine how variation among interacting mutualists, with respect to characteristics such as longevity, dispersal capability, and competitive ability, influence population dynamics and selection in multispecies mutualisms.},

One potential explanation is that changes in the community composition alter the coevolutionary interactions between species, but little evidence exists regarding the occurrence of such changes. Here we present evidence that the pattern of natural selection on plant defence traits, and the probable response to that selection, are critically dependent on the composition of the biotic community. The evolutionary trajectory of defence traits against mammalian herbivory in the Ivyleaf morning glory (), and which defence traits are likely to respond to selection, are both dependent on the presence or absence of insect herbivores. These results indicate that variation in community composition may be a driving force in generating geographical mosaics.},

	Abstract = {Recent research has revealed that evolution often occurs on contemporary timescales, often within decades. Contemporary evolution is associated with the same factors that are driving the current extinction crisis: habitat loss and degradation, overharvesting and exotic species. Thus, it is relevant to many conservation situations. First, habitat fragmentation might influence the potential of a population to adapt in response environmental degradation. Second, certain harvesting Strategies can result in the evolution of life-history traits, ultimately resulting in negative impacts on harvestable yield. Third, the establishment of exotic species can be influenced by their adaptive potential and our ability to limit that potential. Furthermore, contemporary evolution is of concern for intensively managed species, because it might reduce their fitness in native habitats. Ultimately, contemporary evolution is influenced by complex interactions among population size, genetic variation, the strength of selection, and gene flow, making most management scenarios unique. In a world filled with contemporary evolution, conservation efforts that ignore its implications will be less efficient and perhaps even risk prone.},

We discuss criteria to identify when evolution will be diffuse. We advocate a more explicitly trait-oriented approach to diffuse (co)evolution, and discuss how considering effects of interacting species on fitness alone tells us little about evolution. We endorse the view that diffuse evolution occurs whenever the response to selection by one interacting species on a given trait is altered by the presence of a second interacting species. Building on the work of others, we clarify and expand the criteria for diffuse evolution and present a simple experimental design that will allow the detection of diffuse selection. We argue that a greater focus on selection on specific traits and the evolutionary response to that selection will improve our conceptual understanding of how communities affect the evolution of species embedded within them.

Pollen limitation on seed number and seed:ovule ratio occurred at the whole population level. By measuring flowering time, plant size, and various aspects of floral display on both supplementary hand-pollinated plants and control plants, we found a significant relationship between reproductive success and petal size in the control plants, but not in plants that received additional pollen. Reproductive success of plants with white stigmas were more pollen limited than that in orange-stigma plants. It is likely that plants with small petals and white stigmas have lower chances of being recognised by pollinators (Apis mellifera), and that this causes the pollen limitation on reproductive success in such plants. Multivariate selection analyses showed significant linear selection on petal size in control plants, but not in extra-pollinated plants, suggesting pollinator mediated selection on petal size.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the negative and positive effects of agricultural land use for the conservation of biodiversity, and its relation to ecosystem services, needs a landscape perspective. Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.},

We examined how plant gender dimorphism and AM symbiosis affect floral visitors and reproductive output in the gynodioecious plant Geranium sylvaticum. Floral visitors were monitored in a common garden experiment using mycorrhizal plants inoculated with either Glomus claroideum or Glomus hoi and in non-mycorrhizal condition. 3. We hypothesized that because of the larger flower display and pollen presence in hermaphrodites, (i) hermaphrodites receive more floral visitors than females. However, as females produce higher numbers of seeds than hermaphrodites, we predicted that (ii) effective pollinators visit both sexes equally and that (iii) AM symbiosis, although affecting floral characteristics and insect behaviour in general, should not have sex-specific effects on insects that transport pollen. 4. Our results confirm the hypotheses as hermaphrodites received 1·5 times as many floral visitors than females. However, the most important pollinator group, the bumblebees, did not prefer either sex, which may be important for the maintenance of both sexes in gynodioecious populations. We further corroborated that AM symbiosis, although affecting flower size and the amount of pollen, did not affect bumblebee behaviour, whereas other hymenopterans showed a deterrence for G. hoi inoculated plants. 5. This work reports the impact of AM symbiosis on the behaviour of floral visitors in a sexually dimorphic plant species. Positive interactions between plants, floral visitors and AM have been documented previously. However, potential negative tritrophic interactions between plants, floral visitors and AM may also occur. Our results suggest that plant sex and the mycorrhizal status of the plant also influence floral visitor groups that are unlikely to carry out pollination. This may benefit the plants if these floral visitors carry fungal diseases and consume pollen and nectar without effectively vectoring pollen.},

	Abstract = {Disturbance may cause community composition across sites to become more or less homogenous, depending on the importance of different processes involved in community assembly. In north-eastern North America and Europe local (alpha) diversity of forest plants is lower in forests growing on former agricultural fields (recent forests) than in older (ancient) forests, but little is known about the influence of land-use history on the degree of compositional differentiation among sites (beta diversity). Here we analyse data from 1446 sites in ancient and recent forests across 11 different landscapes in north-eastern North America and Europe to demonstrate decreases in beta diversity and in the strength of species2013environment relationships in recent vs. ancient forests. The magnitude of environmental variability among sites did not differ between the two forest types. This suggests the difference in beta diversity between ancient and recent forests was not due to different degrees of environmental heterogeneity, but rather to dispersal filters that constrain the pool of species initially colonizing recent forests. The observed effects of community homogenization and weakened relationships between species distributions and environmental gradients appear to persist for decades or longer. The legacy of human land-use history in spatial patterns of biodiversity may endure, both within individual sites and across sites, for decades if not centuries.

@article{Wolfe2005,
	Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, whereby the phenotype expressed by a genotype depends on the environment in which it is raised, may represent two distinct phenomena. First, plastic responses to the environment may be the adaptive outcome of natural selection having favored genotypes that increase their individual fitness by altering their phenotype in response to one or more environmental cues. Second, phenotypic plasticity may simply represent a genotype's inability to maintain a high-fitness phenotype under certain environmental conditions ( e. g., abiotic stress or limited resources). To determine which of these phenomena characterize the annual plant Raphanus sativus L. ( wild radish: Brassicaceae), we conducted a common garden experiment. We examined 19 greenhouse-bred paternal sibships raised at three planting densities to detect genetic sources of phenotypic variation and to quantify each sibship's phenotypic plasticity with respect to life-history traits, floral traits, and fitness components. To determine whether plasticity affected fitness under high- and low-density conditions, we examined the correlation among sibship means between phenotypic plasticity in each measured trait ( estimated as the difference between the phenotypic values of the trait in each density) and estimates of fitness in each density. At low density, sibships with the highest plasticity exhibited the highest fitness. In high- density conditions, no correlation was detected. This indicates that, in wild radish populations where density varies in time or space, highly canalized genotypes are simply those that cannot respond opportunistically to conditions of high resource availability. By contrast, plastic genotypes responded to low density by growing larger and exhibiting higher fitness. We also estimated the "environmental sensitivity'' of each paternal sibship and trait as the coefficient of variation of trait means across densities. Traits expressed by individual flowers and fruits ( petal size, gynoecium length, pollen and ovule production, pollen size, mean individual seed mass, fruit set, and seed number per fruit) were less sensitive to density than traits more closely related to reproductive output ( e. g., lifetime flower production, maternal fecundity), indicating that the former had experienced selection favoring canalized genotypes as phenotypic plasticity in the latter evolved.},

@article{Wolfe1993,
	Abstract = {This paper examines several aspects of the expression of inbreeding depression in an outcrossing, obligately biennial plant, Hydrophyllum appendiculatum (Hydrophyllaceae). The amount of inbreeding depression detected was small during the first year of life but increased with age and had significant effects on adult size and reproductive traits. The lack of significant inbreeding depression during early growth is likely due to the overriding influence of maternal environmental effects on seed size and seedling growth. However, as maternal effects decreased with age, the seedling's own genotype became a more important determinant of its fate. To examine whether the expression of inbreeding depression was sensitive to ecological conditions, selfed and outcrossed seedlings were grown alone or with other H. appendiculatum seedlings. No inbreeding depression was detected in the plants grown alone. In contrast, under competitive conditions, outcrossed seedlings were significantly larger than selfed seedlings by the end of the first growing season. To address whether parental mating history influences the amount of inbreeding depression expressed, I examined the consequences of two successive generations of selfing on seed set and seed weight. The amount of inbreeding depression increased following the second generation of selfing. In the first generation, seed set and seed weight differed by less than 5\% between selfed and outcrossed progeny. However, both traits were 15\% greater for outcrossed plants after two generations. These results indicate that the alleles responsible for the reductions in these traits were not purged and suggest the action of multiple loci with deleterious effects.},

	Abstract = {To preserve populations of endangered bee species, sound knowledge of their maximum foraging distance between nest and host plants is crucial. Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200 m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50\% of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances.},
